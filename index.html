                            My name is Nick Brown. I am currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am an avid outdoorsman and can often be found on
                            a bike, paddleboard, or mountainside exploreing the outdoors. When I am not spending time outside
                            I am inside most likely reading, writing, or editing code. Around a year ago I found myself looking
                            for a new challenge in life and was met by the complex world of code. Since then I have spent
                            my time absorbing as much information as possible from every source I can find.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My technical coding skills include experience in: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and soon to be many more languages. As for my
                            other professional skills, I have spent the majority of my professional career at the retail
                            cooperative REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.). In that time, I worked my way up from customer
                            service, to sales, then into the shop as a tech level 1, then onto the dock working in order
                            fulfillment, and finally as the operations sales lead. While working as an operations lead, I
                            helped oversee shipping and receiving and inventory management. As a team leader at the store
                            it was my job to help guide employees working under the operations umbrella in addition to running
                            our semi-annual store inventory periods and large used gear sales.
